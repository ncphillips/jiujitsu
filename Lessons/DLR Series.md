# DLR Series

**As an instructor, what are my goals with this series?**

The superficial goal is to get people familiar with DLR so they can start having success using the position.

The deeper goal is to change the way people think about jiujitsu. 

## Class Structure Option 1

### Basic Structure
* Review positioning and base
* New Retention Detail
* New Sweep Completion detail
* Situational Sparring

### Situational
* 2x2 minute rounds each partner
	* Keep it casually, this is a learning exercise not a competition
		* Start at like 20% resistance and gradually increase as desired
	* Person on top stay in toreando grips
		* Only start attacks for the ways we learned to defend so far
		* Once frames are cleared finished the pass however you want
	* Person on bottom stay in DLR
		* Only do the sweeps we've learned so far
		* Once their butt hits the floor, finish the sweeps however you want
	* Reset when
		* Person on top strips all grips and passes
		* Person on bottom completes a sweep
		* Person on top escapes once their but hits the floor\\

### Part 1: Intro
* Basic positioning
* Base when standing
	* Diagonal base => good
	* Same side base => bad

### Part 2: Hip Strip Defence, Over-Under Pass

### Part 4: Changing Sides, Pass to Mount

##  Positioning
### Concept: The Fort

The set of frames, hooks, and wedges you're using to defend yourself and prevent your opponent from advancing in position.

### Basic Structure
Start with a simple explanation. Get everyone to go in an dout of it a couple times. 

1. Opponent standing with one leg forward. 
2. Flat on your back
3. Bottom leg hooks their leg laces up
4. Top leg is on their hip
5. Bottom hand grabs their ankle
6. Top hand is grabbing their collar

### Detailed Structure

#### Top Leg 
* Foot is on the ASIS
	* Bones not Muscle
	* Higher is at risk of foot locks
	* Lower is at risk of stuffing
	* Flexed foot
* Knee is internally rotated
	* Acting like a knee shield
	* Makes stuffing harder
	* Makes overriding the knee easier (more on that later)

#### Details of Top Hand
* Hand on the collar bone 
	* Bones not Muscle
	* Grab really high up
* Other grips can be used later
	* Sleeve
	* Cross Sleeeve
	* Belt/Pants

#### Details of Bottom Hand
* Grab onto their achiles
	* Motorcycle twist to internally rotate their knee
	* Also use palm against the front of their shin to prevent sliding forward.
* Grip on Pants
	* Really good when you don't have control with your top hand
	* Keep elbow tight to your body. 

#### Details of Body & Bottom Leg
* Head in line with their shoulder
* Thigh is vertical
	* Bones not muscle
	* Harder to grip
* Flat on your back, not on either side.
* Hamstring pressure into their shin
	* Straightens their leg
	* If they push in it will be easier to establish the hook
* Foot laces on inside of their thigh
	* Shallow, closer to the knee where you'll often be
	* Deep, close to the hip is where it's strongest
	* Internal rotation	

## Balance on Top

### Concepts: Diagonal Base
* Technical Standup: hands and feet on floor
* Standing in DLR: hands on their body, feet on floor
### Balance while Attacking 
* **The Wrong Way:** effortless to off balance
	* Strip back top leg with weight back
	* Strip hook with weight forward
* **The Right Way:** hard to off balance
	* Strip back top leg with weight forward
	* Strip hook with weight back

Get everyone to drill this. The goal is for everyone to get a feel for the balance point both on top and on bottom.

## Primary Attack: Tipover
### Completing the Sweep
#### One Hand Posted
##### General Approach
* Breaking down the shoulder
* Side Foot / Live Foot
* Butterfly

##### Specific Endings
* Over-under
* Headquarters

#### Two Hands Posted
* Body Lock from Leg Pin
* Mount from Knee Override

## Retention

#### Level 1: Palm Out
* Palm Out on Hook Leg: Extend leg to hip
* Palm Out on Extended Leg: Knee to chest, circle in to spider

#### Level 2: Palm In
* Palm in on Hook Leg: Pressure on knee, hip escape, extend
* Palm in on Extended Leg: Knee to chest, then foot on floor, rotate in, spider
