A post is a load bearing [[Structure]]

Examples:
* When standing, your legs are posts on the ground.
* When on mount, the arms post on the ground to prevent a reversal from bridging.
* When performing an x-pass you often post on their chest to help keep them down and make it easiser to kick the leg up
