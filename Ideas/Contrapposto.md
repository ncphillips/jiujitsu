> The disposition of the human figure in which one part is turned in opposition to another part (usually hips and legs one way, shoulders and chest another) creating a counter-positioning of the body about it's central axis. It is sometimes called "weight shift" because the weight of the body tends to be thrown to one side and there is relaxation on the other.

The concept of Contrapposto is important to [[Kuzushi]] as the most efficient way to break someones balance is to first bring them out of this counter-position. As their weight becomes single sided, they become vulnerable to attack. There is a magic point where they will be so offballance that they will be totally unable to resist the technique. 

Contrapposto is a special case of [[Mass Between Posts]] for standing.
