# Berimbolo

## Berimbolo setup from Double Pull

Setup [[De La Riva]] from [[Double Pull]]

Sit on their foot forcing extensin. This will throw the [[Muscle Synergy]] out of wack and make it easier to internally rotate their knee. 

Opposite leg should be on either the inside of their thigh so you can push them more or behind you to help shrimping around. Do *not* put your foot on the ground (they can DLR you) and do not put it under their armpit (the can footlock you).

Internally rotate their leg using pressure from your hooking leg.

Push on their thigh with your farside leg and override the knee, this will help keep their leg internally rotated.

Their weight should be on their farside hip

Sit in DLR double pull and see who can get their opponents knee turned in

## Berimbolo Grip Fighting

Grips are required to do great berimbolo.

### When they strip the Collar

It will be harder for them to strip the collar girp when their weight is on the farside leg and their knee is internally rotated.

Once their farside arm goes across the body to grip fight, put the farside foot on their shoulder to neutralize that hand.

Grabbing for the [[ASIS]] on the nearside will be even harder for them to defend because they will only have one hand instead of two.

### When they strip the ASIS

Your farside foot is still on their bicep/shoulder.

Your farside hand gets some control, then you switch to an inside c-grip with your nearside hand to pull their arm away. 

Now you can grab the collar or hip grip.
