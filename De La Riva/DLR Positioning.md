# DLR Positioning

To get the perfect ankle collar DLR as instructed by [[Mikey Musumeci]].

## Body
* Flat on your back
* Head in line with their shoulder
* Shin contacted with your butt/thigh.
* The higher their foot is on your body, ther harder it is to get a hook

## Hooking Hand
* Grip far behind on their achiles and then twist to internally rotating the knee.
* The skin stretches, that's why you go too far at first.
* Acts a check, keeping them from pulling away or moving the foot up too high.

Detail from [[Jon Thomas]]
* If you don't have a grip with the other hand, a pant grip is more secure. Otherwise they can probably kick out. 



## Hooking Leg
* Leg wraps around the outside
* Foot should be flexed strongly; toes almost gripping the thigh
* Quad fairly vertical so that most of the downward pressure goes into your [[Bones not Muscles]].

## Opposite Hand
* Try to grab the collar high so when you pull down your first is on their collarbone
* Keep your arm straight, use your scapula rather than elbows to pull them in.

## Opposite Leg
* Ideal position is on the anterior sacro illiac spine [[ASIS]] bone in the front of their hip. See [[Frames in Guard]]
* At least try to stay above the knee
* Hip should stay active to prvent the leg from being pressed down so don't over-extend.
