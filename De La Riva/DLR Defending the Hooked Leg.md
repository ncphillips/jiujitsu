# Defending the Hooked Leg
[[Mikey Musumeci]]

## Thumb Out
* The opponent pushes down on the DLR hook palm out, weight back
* If you're starting to get turned to the side you can use your foot on their hip to lift your hips and recenter
* Extend the hook and put your foot on their hip.
	* If their palm is in, you might have to put your foot on the ground first.
* This will make a [[Bent Elbow]] and pull their weight more forward.
* Re-establish the DLR. 

## Thumb In
If the person puts their thumb-in the previous technique won't work. It is much stronger position and prevents the foot from extending. Theoretically the only option is to get around the thumb by going to a [[Spider Guard]]. This is a *bad idea* because it opens you up to a leg throw pass. So...


* The opponent pushes down hard with the thumb in with all their weight on the back leg.
* Get your foot pushed agains the side of their leg.
* Collar drag away from the hook and press laterally with your hook leg. It will be easy if they're totally committed to stripping the hook. 
* Once their head is turned away, pull down.
* They will be pushed off balance towards their back leg.
* Use your hand to lift the foot on the hook-side to help move their balance even more.
* Connect hook foot to their hip.
* Pull back up to DLR
* Try to turn their foot in and sit on it so their toes across instead of up your body.
