# DLR on the Ground

[[Mikey Musumeci]]

A good review of hip grip sweeps is in Part 2.4 at 27:30.

## Posted on 1 Hand
### Collar Grip
* [[Attacking the Technical Standup]] by pulling on their collar. This will help you get up later. Keep the arm straight when pulling to avoid the [[Bent Elbow]] problem.
* Move your hook to the ground and push up to a [[Shoulder Tripod]].
* Move the farside leg from ASI to a Butterfly Hook
* Finish coming up by **pulling the collar** and either:
	* Posting the hook-side hand
	* Grabing under their knee.
### Hip Grip: Ankle Pick
* Your Oppononent
	* Post on DLR side hand
	* Grab your top ankle to prevent you from pushing them down
	* Open their bottom knee
	* Start to technical standup.
* Switch from cross hip-pant grip to cross ankle-pant grip. This prevents her pulling her leg out, and by lifting her leg it puts more weight down into her hip.
* Let go of the DLR ankle grip and post
* Press your top leg onto their hip to start a technical standup (side foot live foot)
* You will both be in almost mirrored positions, except you have her bottom leg and she has your top leg....you're in the stronger position

### Hip Grip to Leg Drag
* Your opponent posts on one hand but keeps their butt on the ground.
* Switch to the ankle-pant girp
* Top leg switches from the ASIS to the butterfloy hook. 
* Scoot in really close
* Cup over the knee of their bottom leg so you can pull it in deeper and pressure her leg towards the floor
* Your top knee switches from pointing up to pointing down and pinches down on their bottom leg. Knee on the ASIS
* All the weight goes on the hip/bottom leg

Important detail. If you're not careful they could possibly explode up and just step around your legs. So what stops this? At first it's your DLR hook. The foot is still framed on the inside of their leg/hip. Then when you scoot in and leg-drag it's your knee pressuring on their hip that prevents them from standing.


## Posted on Two Hands

### Pinning the Leg

* Your opponent posts both hands back and starts trying to get up. 
* Do the same side-foot=> live foot => tripod  movement as with 1 hand posted.
* **Pull your hook foot back and sit with their foot trapped between your calf and thigh. (Key Difference)**
* Move the farside foot to the floor and attack a body lock. 


### Overriding the Knee
#### Hip-to-Hip (Collar Grip)
* Use your DLR hook to internally rotate their knee so it points straight up.
* Jump the knee over her knee and bar your knee hip to hip.
* Tripod
* Pull yourself up using your heel on their body and quad.

#### Hip-to-Shoulder (Hip Grip)

* Bring shin from near hip to far shoulder. 
* Use your foot in their armpit to flatten them out a bit by hooking the arm and kicking into that 
* Scrunch your head in close to their hip
* Slide your butt up past their kneeline
* Post your hand and sit up to mount

## Opening the Knee 
### Opponents Positioning
* Get on toes of back leg
* Post on one hand
* Pressure forward and turn the knee outwards
* It's too late, you can't switch to the cross grip
* DLR hook is starting to slide out

### Chest Kick

* Take the extended foot off the ASIS and put it on their chest/bellybutton.
* Pull your DLR hook in shallow to straighten their leg.
* Pull with hook, push on chest, to straighten leg. Opening the knee requires the leg bent.
