# DLR Defending against a Lapel grip

When the opponent grabs your lapel they are posting on your body.

## Elbow Straight
* Weight forward
	* Push them back so you can sit up
	* Weight will be removed from your chest
	* Start to [[DLR Hookside Tipover]]
* Weight backward
	* Their weight isn't on you and the elbow is open
	* Attack the arm (i.e. omoplata, triangle, etc.)

## Elbow Bent

Relaly similar to [[DLR Defending the Hooked Leg]]

* Weight foreward
	* They will be quite unstable
	* Immediately go for the [[DLR Hookside Tipover]]
* Weight backwards
	* Push them away so they have to base.
	* As they come back switch to the deeper DLR where sitting on the foot
