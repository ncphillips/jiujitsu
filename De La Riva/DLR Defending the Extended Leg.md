# DLR: Defending the Extended Leg

[[Mikey Musumeci]]

Your oppontent may strip your foot with a gi or no-gi grip, but what really matters is the positioning of their elbow. In both cases the goal is to re-establish frame by moving to a spider guard, then switching back to the ASI

## Elbow Out
* Pull your knee to your chest
* Use [[Foot Pummeling]] to get your foot iside of their arm
* Press on their wrist with the blade of your foot
* Establish [[Spider Guard]]
* Switch back to the ASI

## Elbow
* Put your foot on the ground
* Press your knee foreward so it spider against their elbow
* When you bring your foot back up it will be easier to get [[Inside Control]]
* Establish [[Spider Guard]]
* Switch back to the ASI
