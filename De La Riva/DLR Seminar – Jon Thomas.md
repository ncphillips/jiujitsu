# DLR Seminar Jon Thomas

DLR is great b/c it's easy get there.

Basic Setup from seated guard. Grab a Cross Collar grip and fall to opposite side and shoot the shin up across the hips. Pull them over your knee shield. Make sure the opposute leg is outside their leg so they don't start knee cutting.

There are two ways to deal with the extended leg: stuff it or leg drag. The knee shield is great because it makes both of those options more difficult.

If they're leg is too straight and you're having trouble establishing the hook, you can apply pressure on their knee by undoing the hook and internally rotating your leg (knee in, foot out). This will kind of knee bar them, encouraging them to step forward. 

Pesting with grips: collar, sleeve, hip. 

Even if your knee is disconnected near your chest, you still want to keep it internally rotated like the knee shield. If you don't it's way too easy to for them to stuff your leg . 

Keeping the knee shield in DLR makes it easier to defend the knee cut. As soon as they cut you already have a knee shield to start making space. 

If they deadlift when you have the collar or sleeve, just raise up with them. 

Transitioning to situp guard. Extend their leg with knee pressure. Before you let go of the ankle grip to situp bite back on their calf to prevent them from pulling away. The further you push them back, the easier it's going to be to sit up. 

Don't grab behind their knee with your hand, use the elbow. 

Pendulum sweep. Switch to a cross-sleeve underneath their leg and then grap the collar. Don't fall backwards to do the sweep, switch the hook to the floor and pressure forward/sideways. Your body be angled forward the whole time. 

Two shallow DLR hooks: 
* laces on the hamstring is the easiest to get, but it's the pretty weak
* laces high in the hip/groin is really strong 

When playing situp guard and they deadlift 
* If you can't grab their sleeve or collar, pull the lapel out and pass it underneath. 
* If your foot is on their hip you they need to grab your leg to stuff or leg-drag, exposing their sleeve.

From DLR situp, bring both feet up and bump them to the right.
