# DLR Balance

## Rule 1: Cross-Balance

Remember [[Contrapposto]] and the [[Walking Kuzushi Chart.jpeg]] when playing DLR

1. Weight foreward to strip extended leg
2. Weight backwards to strip the hook

If they do not follow these rules they will be easily sweapt to the side their weighted on.

The person on top practices stripping the hook and extended leg, alternating between breaking the frames with contrapposto then without. 

The person on bottom practices noticing where their opponents base is, and sweeping when they break contrapposto.

## Rule 2: Hands or Feet

* When their weight is on their legs, their arms are light.
* When their weight is on their arms, their legs are light.
