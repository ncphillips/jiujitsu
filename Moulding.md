Moulding is whenever your opponent closes up (e.g. brings their elbow to tight to their side). The idea is to think of it as if the two parts of their body are literally moulded together and will move as a single unit. 

For example if they bring their right elbow to their ribs, they don't have a post on their right side.

When you're attacking a limb, your opponent must mould or else you will get the submission.
