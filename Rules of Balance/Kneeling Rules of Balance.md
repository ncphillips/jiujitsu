# Kneeling Rules of Balance

1. When the opponent's knee/calf and elbow/ribs are moulded they're vulnerable to the sides
2. When they open their knees, they're vulnerable to getting pulled foreward
3. When they widen their feet and keep their knees together, they're vulnerable to getting pushed back.
5. When weight is on butt they're vulnerable to the back
6. When weight is on knees, vulnerable to the front

## Drills

The important part of all these drills is the feeling of your opponent's balance/base. The exact drills don't matter quite as much. 

### Drill #1: Scissor Sweep

* Opponent is kneeling with their legs parallel and their elbow [[Moulding]] to their side. 
* You are on your side
	* Top foot is on their shoulder
	* Top arm is cross collar
	* Bottom foot is on the floor blocking their leg.
	* Bottom arm is on sleeve
* Close their elbow even more.
* Pull the collar to sweep to the floor

### Drill #2: Collar Drag

* Opponent is kneeling with their knees wide.
* You are in sit up guard
* Step one foot outside
* Put other foot blocking their far knee from the inside
* Drag them straight forward as you sit out to the side

### Drill #3: Knee Pick
(Careful)

* Opponent is kneeling with their feet wide
* Hold the outside of their knee + collar
