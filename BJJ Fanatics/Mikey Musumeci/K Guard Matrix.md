# Concepts
## Interplay of Upper and Lower Body Attacks
* When attacking the upper body they must defend with the lower body
* When attacking the lower body they must defend with the upper body

How does this relate to kguard?

Our opportunity to enter kguard will come after we attack their upper body.

## Moulding

* When two limbs connect togeter, we can think of them as being moulded together. 

People are usually doing this defend the two limbs. When the elbow is moulded to the ribs it's hard to attack the arm, but they're vulnerable to losing balance. If they don't defend they get swept, if they do defend you can attack their arm. 

## Agonist & Antagonist Muscles

* Whatever direction they're defending they're weak in the opposite direction.

For example, if someone is defending against you pulling their knees apart it wll be easier to push them together. 

## Rules of Balance

* Base
	* Linear Base
		* Knees Together, Feet Narrow  =>  Move to sides
	* Tripod Base Balance
		* Knees Wide => Pull forward
		* Feet Wide => Push backwards
* Head Position
	* Weight on Heels => if head goes behind heels they fall
	* Weight on knees => if head goes ahead of knees they fall
* Back Position
	* Hunched => pull forward
	* Postured => push backward
* Weight Distribution
	* Weight on Butt => Knees are Light
	* Weight on Knees

# K Guard
## Major Objective
* Get the leg inside the legs
* Scoop Grip / Underhook
