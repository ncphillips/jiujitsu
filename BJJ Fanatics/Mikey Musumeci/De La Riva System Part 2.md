# De La Riva System Part 2

## World 1 Overhead Sweep Intro
World 1 Familly 2: Collar + Leg Grip

The advantage of that grip is they can post on our body to keep us down and stop themselves from falling. Our goal is to pull all their weight onto us so we can destroy their base and sweep them overhead. 

Rules of Balance
* Diagonal base
* Aligned spine
* If one side is heavy, the other is light

Dealing with Frames
* Break e.g. defending the dlr hook
* Go around e.g. pushing their hips back when they post on you
* Get under e.g. pulling more weight onto you when they post on your chest

Collar Grip Points
* Pinky down puts their weight down in their feet. 
* Pinky out makes it easier to pull them forward.

Overhead Flip
* They flip over your head–they don't flip over their own head–and land on their side perpendicular to your body, so you can immediately start berimbolo.
* Pull their weight with the collar grip and bring your knees to your chest.
* Their weight will go forward and they will post on the ground.
* Their hips should be balanced above you, your feet acting as tables
	* Extended leg on the ASIS
	* DLR hook lets go and that foot holds up their far leg.
* Use the hook-side hand to pull their shin forward.
* Use your collar grip to turn their face away

## Headquarters

[[DLR Defending Head Quarters]]

## What to do when they defend the overhead sweep. 

They're going to defend by putting their weight back on their back leg. When they do this their front leg will be light, making it easier to turn their foot inside and expose their hips. 

## DLR Hip Grip
* The hip grip is on the ASIS.
* Try to get arm on outside of their front arm. 
* With this hip grip, the extended leg can move towards the belly button. 

Only get the hip grip when it's in front of you. Don't grab when they're square. If you do that, you're misaligning your own spine making yourself weight. 

Use the hip grip the same way you sue the Collar grip for the tipover sweep. i.e. pull towards you then push to the side. 

## Babybolo

You got the hip grip and started coming around the back. 
* The extended foot can either 
	* move to the near ASIS
	* go on the floor
* The DLR foot extends to block the far hip from the inside.
	* Make sure your kneeline doesn't go pass their thigh, else you're exposed to knee bars
	* Use the tibialis flexion to pull their far hip towards you
* Bottom hand underhooks their back leg.
	* Caio Tero gave Mikey this detail. 
* Bright the outisde foot behind the knee in a matrix-ish hook
* Square up the hips and pull both knees into crab ride
* Double hip grip prevents them from turning left or right.

### DDLR Getting to the Backback.
There are two approaches: move around them, or turn them to you. 

#### Moving Yourself
* Their weight must be heavy on their feet.
* Drop from elbow to shoulder on bottom arm. 
* Overhook their front leg with your bottom arm and grab their knee. Keep the elbow close to their foot. 
* Give them a push forward before pulling yourself around.

#### Moving Them

* If they're weight is on their hands attacking your extended leg their legs must be lighter.
* Flex your DDLR hook and pull them backwards.
 
### I can't get my matrix hook in DDLR

Hook above their knee, with your knee pointing in. Use that shin to pressure them forward. Once they step pike back again and put your hook in. 

## Sweeping Review

Sweeping requires your opponents hips to stay pinned to the floor. The opponent is going to try and prevent that with one of 3 approaches:
1. Put weight in the hands and lift butt
2. Put weight on feet and stand up
3. Diagonal base

## Sweeping with the Hip Grip

People often defend the sweep by posting their hands and lifting their feet off the floor.

When you have the hip grip you can pressure into their hip to keep them pinned and tripod to come up using the farside butterfly hook. [[DLR]]

## Defending the Turn Out

If they sit and try to sit forward and turn their knee out.
Put foot on chest and push them back.
Get a much more shallow dlr and pull backon foot.
In order for them to open their knee their leg must be bent.
Pulling the leg with the ankle + thigh/calf pinch while pushing on their chest straightens their leg, preventing the turn out

### When can you not do this

This doesn't work if they've already got their knee to the ground and have 

## Pummeling
You've swept your opponent and they've posted one hand. They're using the other hand to grab your pantleg and push your leg away.

Two reactions:
* Arm straight
	* Pummel foot under their wrist
	* Push on bicep
	* Foot to chest
* Arm bent
	* Pummel foot on top of their arm
	* Push against/bicep arm
	* if they push back, pummel under
	
## Part 6
### Person Removes the DLR
#### The Starting Position
* You have the collar grip.
* Go for overhead
* They defend by sitting back
* Switch to hip grip
* Because their weight is back their front foot is light.
* Lift their foot off the ground by pulling their knee to your chest
* Stuff their foot so it's perpendicular to your spine

#### Their Counter
They undo that movement
* They open the extended knee away from the hip
* They grab your same-side collar and push the shoulder
* Pressure knee forward toward your chest so the foot comes off the ground.
* Pummel foot back to parallel

#### They Remove the Hook
You're in DLR with a hip grip. They pressure down and remove your hook and you can't pummel back. When you have the collar you can use it to drag them off balance and post, but we don't have that now.

Going back, we usually don't remove the extend foot from the ASIS b/c it's too easy to stuff, but with the hip grip we're not as concerned because it's harder for them to step forward. So...
* Straight arm hip grip to keep them from advancing
* Move extended foot down closer to their knee
* Push them backwards
