# Introduction
## Berimbolo Step-by-Step
* Step 1: Secure Positional Control
	* Grips
		* Forward hip grip
		* Middle grip
		* Far hip grip
		* Collar grip
	* Body Positioning
		* How to use all parts of your body to move your opponent.
* Step 2: Inversion
	* How to Invert
		* Shoulders
		* Neck
		* Forward
	* How to Unvert
		* Pull in
		* Push away
* Step 3: Hip-to-hip connection
	* Pull yourself in
		* Stack your opponent
	* Pull your opponent onto you
		* Stack your opponent
* Step 4: Two World
	* Weight on front hip => Take the back
	* Weight on back hip => Sweeping mechanics
* Step 5: Head above Head
	* This is the point when 
	* Requires upper body control

## Observeration Mode
* Always observing our opponent and attacking them based on where they are.

## Learning Reactions
* Learn the reactions
* Don't just do the move, teach your partner the reaction in detail. Do the reaction in detail yourself.

## Why start in double pull?
* All the bermibolo attacks start once their butt is on the floor.
* This has nothing to do with double pull
* The setups from other guards are covered in other series

## Inverting Troubles?
*  There are ways to berimbolo without inverting on your neck
*  This isn't just about being flexible

# Double Pull
Whether you get here from double pull or from a sweep

## Two Worlds
* Weight on Feet
	* DLR is easy
* Weight on Butt
	* DLR is hard
	* Leg drags
	* Foot locks

## Holistic Approaches
We can't just attack a single limb because the other limbs will reinforce it. By tactically attacking multiple limbs we can greatly weaken the entire body. 

### Example: Turning in the Knee
In DLR the goal is usually to turn their knee inwards. What muscles are keeping their leg externally rotated?
* Dorsi-Flexion in the foot
	* Press down on the pinkey toe
	* SIt on foot

> Nolan Thought: Don't create internal rotation by internally rotating your leg. Instead, externally rotate it a bit so their calf is behind your thigh. Then, it won't be internal rotation muscles, but hamstring flex muscles. i.e. My hamstring vs their rotators
## Soft Tissue vs Bone
Must post on bone if you want to have a strong position.

## Far Leg
* Dont's
	* Sitting on hip/under armpit => Foot locks
	* Put on floor => DLR
* Do's
	* Frame on the inside of their theight
	* Nested behind

## Double DLR 
Drill having both people in double pull with DLR hooks. 
Practice "grip" fighting. i.e. both of you try ot get the internal rotation

## Foot on Leg Defense
Their weight is on their same side as your hook.
They're opposite foot is on the inside of your thigh and maybe they're grabbing your pant sleeve.
When you internally rotate their knee their weight will shift to their other hip.
This decreases their power in the. hip

## Hand Fighting
We have two main grips:
* Collar
* Hip

### Collar
It's harder for them to break the collar grip once their knee is internally rotated and their weight is on the other hip. 

The extended leg can press against their shoulder/bicep to take. (Toes on shoulder is safe; toes under shoulder is dangerous)

Lean onto outside elbow to get an angle and make it harder for them to fight.

### Hip
* When they go to attack your grip
* Place your foot on their far shoulder to nullify that arm
* Use your outside hand to tie up their remaining arm
* Establish grip on hip, or collar
