# Enter the System: Leg Locks

## Overview
### Six Essential Skills
1. Grip and Inside Position
2. Distance and Connection
3. Breakdown to a Hip
4. Negate Resistance
5. Heel Exposure
6. Breaking

### Three Subsystems
1. Straight Ashi
2. Cross Ashi
3. Reverse Ashi

### Each subsystem has a central problem
1. Straight Ashi => Shared Spiral
2. Cross Ashi => Turnout Problem
3. Reverse => Crossed Leg Problem

### Ten Core Principles
1. Double Trouble: when attacking one leg, the majority of the resistance will come from the other leg
2. Dilemma: Create dilemma's not problems. If they escape one submission they are walking into another.
3. Percentage: Some moves have a higher likely hood of working then others. 
4. Central Problem: In any situation there is one central problem to the position. (i.e. the theory of constraints)
5. Separation: Divorce the Mechanism of Control from the Mechanism of Break
6. Hierarchy
7. Opposing Forces
8. Hollistic Teaching
9. Multiple Ashi
10. Closed/Open Principle

### Teaching in Systems Requires
* Sequential Progressoin
* Completeness

## Essential Skill 1: Grip and Inside Position

Without grip and inside position, no amount of leg lock finish details will matter.


### Grips

####  Positive and Negative Gripping

* Negative gripping is defensive. Actively trying to deny your opponents control, without actually gaining any yourself. 

* Positive gripping is assertive and purposeful.

Positive gripping requires you know what you're looking to accomplish. 

Example: If I want to get my opponent is kneeling and I want to get at their legs, I might get double wrist control and attempt an arm drag. To defend against the arm drag they might step up into combat base, at which point I can switch to the ankle grip and enter an ashi

#### Immovable Elbow
*  Your arm has the most strength when the elbow is closed to your side. 

People tend to get a grip, and then use all their effor to control it

The connection between the elbow and the hip is extremely strong. When I get a 2-on-1 I bring my elbows to my hips, and bring my head forward. 

It's not a battle of grip strength, it's a battle of grip tactics. 

Rather then fight the grip when your opponent moves, you move with them. 

**Drill:** Butt scoot. Get 2-on-1 control of your standing opponents arm. As they pull back, walk your legs forward, one at a time. 

See [[Open Elbow]]

#### Push Pull Mechanics

* Our grips reveal opportunities as we move alternate between pushing and pulling.

The point of getting a grip is always to advance the position. Getting the grip and just holding it is annoying, but not threatening. We want to be threatening. 

To be threatening, we need to use the grips to push and pull. Not only that, we must switch between pushing and pulling 

#### Upper Body Control

**The Purpose of Upper Body Gripping:** We can't attack the legs immediately. The point of upper body grips is to get them to expose their legs when they go to defend the upper body. 

##### Arm Control

###### Three Main Grips
1. 2-on-1 down grip
2. 2-on-1 up grip
3. wrist + elbow control

A grip is weak in the direction between the thumb and index finger. The idea behind 2-on-1 is our hands reinforce each other by covering the weakest part of the grips.

###### When to use each grip?
1. Down Grip: if their hands are low. This usually happens if they're standing and you're sitting.
2. Up Grip: if their hands are high. This usually happens if they're kneeling and looking to push your upper body
3. Elbow Grip: if their hands are neutral

If you have one of the grips, it's easy to switch to the others grips.

It's always an *exchange*. You'll rarely just get your grips and keep going. 


##### Torso Control 
* Collar Elbow Grip
* Double Underhook
* Deep Underhook
* Double Triceps
	* high up behind the shoulders
	* not down near the elbows

**Double Underhooks:** A lot of people do a gable grip behind the back. Danaher holds high on the shoulders, almost like double sticky hooks, and pulls the elbows in close. 
We need to get our opponents hands above our shoulderline if we're going to attack the legs. 


Danaher gets one arm controlled with a tricep grip, and then controls the torso with the other. That second one can be an underhook, collar tie, etc. 

**SKILL TO DRILL:** Breaking a thumb grip. Opponent has double bicep control with tumbs in. Establish Double Tricep and turn your elbows in so their thumbs roll off.

Pull them forward in a butterfly position, with them posting above your head. 

Overhooks are good holds for attacking the upper body,but not the lower body
#### Lower Body Control
##### 2 on 1 Leg Control

Whenever we see a posted leg to the outside we want to look for a 2-on-1 leg grip.

Leg Grip
* Wrist deep
* Outside hand on calf; inside hand on thigh
* Don't pull the leg; keep it in place and pull yourself towards the knee.
* Bring your knee in so that it's under/behind their knee
* The hands are just there to keep him from stepping out.
* It's your knee pulling towards your chest that gets him in


##### Shin to Shin from Kneeling

What actually passes your guard in a knee cut, is the *knee*. (ref Musumeci power concept)

Your opponent gets their foot between your legs to start knee cutting. 
* Post both your hands on their knee to prevent them advancing. 
	* Make sure your elbows are tight to your hip so they can't get upper body control.
	* Put your weight on the inside hip, swing your outside leg out wide, and then pull your foot in for a shin-to-shin. 
		* You don't need to be flexible, and you don't have to totally move.
	* The inside hand cross-shoulder frames
	* The outside hand hooks the knee wrist deep
	* Sit back and slide the foot in 

##### Shin to Shin from Standing

* Scoot forward
* Hook their front leg with your same side foot from the inside
* Overhook their leg at the knee with the same side hand. Wrist deep, palm down on the calf.
* Your foot and hand grips reinforce each other. 
* Sit out to the side and post with the inside hand to pull them forward where their base is weak. 
* They will likely either step forward or fall forward to post with their hands

##### Scoop Grip

It's an underhook on the leg. 

It's better for coaching to be unambiguous. We don't want people to get confused when calling out instructions.

Scoop grip should be lifting on the calf and wrapping around the top of the knee.

##### Ankle Grip

* Outside Hand
	* Pinky down
	* Forarm pressing down on the laces of their foot
	* Low to the ground for highest leverage
* Inside foot foot hooks their back leg and pull them forard
* Outside Leg
	* first connects with the shin
	* shoot knee in and connect to calf from behind
* Kuzushi
	* Bring your knee to your opposite shoulder
	* Push out with the hooking leg
	* Rotate their ankle with your hand
	* This will off balance them to the outside so they have to post

### Attaining Inside Position
#### Inside vs Outside Position
* Inside Position is for exposing limbs
* Outside position is for exposing the back

We want inside position for leg locks. Generally both legs inside is better, but just one can work. 

#### From Kneeling Closed Guard

Shrimp out to get a supine butterfly hook. Then shrimp out to get the other one.
Bring knees to chest to load them up, then push them back so you can sit up into butterfly.

#### From Standing Closed Guard

Standing closed guard
Get one inside and one outside leg grip
Drop into kguard toward the inside grip
Pummel the bottom leg into

#### From De La Riva

* Underhook their shin and grab your own shin
* Move them off balance towards their front getting their weigh ton their hands and back leg.
* Lift their leg up and switch a scoop grip


#### Pummelling Legs from Top Position

People playing a seated guard usually have their feet close together, making getting inside position a bit difficult. You don't want to just step up square else they'll likely hook your feet. 

Lines of Demarcation
* Toe
* Ankle
* Knee
* Hip

Basic Entry against Seated
* Initially we just step u pto the toe line.
	* Stepping up to ankle line gives them inside position.
* Bent forward pretty low, almost in line with the opponent.
* Rear hand posts on their shoulders/head.
* Front hand grip fights
	* Ideally get a cross grip but same side works
* Push on their upper body and step aggressive forward with the back leg between their legs to the knee line

Crescent Step against Seated
* They're seated with their feet in tight so there's no where's to step inside.
* Post on their upper body
* Step laterally, past their knee line
* Crescent step around to their hip
* Either they're slow and you get the back or they open up to start backing away allowing you to get inside position

Kneeling vs Seated

##### Suppine Opponent

Best to Worse Position
* Both legs inside – great
* One leg inside (Headquarters)
* Both legs to one side (leg drag) 
* Both legs outside (butterfly hooks) – bad

**Leg Pummeling Drill*
1. standing vs seated: This is what lance showed us.
2. butterfly elevation
	1. Pummel both feet inside
	2. Pummel one foot to the otherside

Goals with Leg Pummeling
* Use your knees to clear your opponents knees to the side
* Pummel your feet inside their feet

## Essential Skill 2: Distance and Connection
### Irimi Ashi
The jab of the leg-lock game. This is the one you'll use the most. 

You *must* become proficient in it's use.

This is essentially SLX on the ground. 

#### Position
* Inside Leg
	* Knee pointing up
	* Inside foot underneath the opponent
		* Cross Position (SLX stlye) e.g. my left under their left buttocks
			* Benefit: Greater control over the leg
		* Straight Position	e.g. my left under their right buttocks
			* Benefit: Greater ability to elevate the opponent
	* Inside knee pressures towards outside ankle
* Outside Leg
	* Wraps around 

Danaher prefers the straight position. This makes it easier to get the knee-to-ankle pinching 

#### Squeezing vs Scissoring

*  Squeezing is less efficient then scissoring
*  Ashi
	*  Outside leg pulls down on the leg
	*  Inside shin pushes forward

### Knee and Knee Line
* Knee Line
	* Straight line joining my knees together
* When attacking a leg, the opponents knee must be well inside your knee line.

It's better to overkill and get as deep as possible 

Never try to attack a heel hook if their knee is not inside your knee line

### Drills
#### Ashi Connection
* Setup
	* Sitting in double pull
	* Pummel both legs inside
	* Use 2-on-1 to pull in and get their knee inside your kneeline
	* Establish the Ashi and scoot in far
* As the opponent moves around you should be able to maintain the ashi without using your hands
	* Roll left
	* Roll right 
	* Pull backwards
	
#### Ashi Entry

* Seated with Standing opponent
* Double outer scoop grip on calfs
* Feet go between their legs
* Lift your butt off the floor and pull yourseif to suppine position betwen their legs. 
	* Most of the pull comes from the legs
	* Hands just keep them from stepping back
	* Your hips must go *past* their ankle line.
* Fire your legs up into the Ashi Irimi

#### Gravity Drill 1: SLX
Gotta keep the rocking chair shape. .
* Establish SLX 
* Let go and rock down
* As you rock back up to SLX on the other side

This should be pretty easy. If you're talking your voice shouldn't change while you move. 

#### Gravity Drill 2: 4-11
* Lying supine, head towards standing partner.
* Grab ankles and invert putting feet inside partners legs
* Inside foot connets with laces
* Outside foot comes around the outsid and a 

![[Pasted image 20210531174526.png]]

#### Gravity Drill 3: Iminari roll

* Partner standing
* Sit in front, at 45 degee angle
* Lean sideways and contact behind their knee with your wrist 
* Fall backk so you end up suppine head parallel with them and bring your other hand around the outside
* Lift your legs up and do the motions from Drill 2

### Recovering the Knee line
Opponent is pulling their leg out of the ashi
#### Inside Scoop
1. Inside hand digs under their knee elbow deep
2. Outside hand grabs the top top of the foot/shin
3. Open legs and put them on the floor to prevent them from pulling
4. Scoot in
5. Reestablish
#### 2-on-1
1. They pull back
2. Sit forward bringing your head far forward
3. 2-on-1 grip knee and ankle
4. Pull yourself hard into them

#### Cross-Ashi Outside Scoop
1. Sitting in cross-ashi
2. They pull away
3. Outside scoop and grab your own thigh
4. Sit backward and they will be pulled back in

## Essential Skill 3: Breakdown to a Hip

### Single Leg Ashi

#### Basic Details
* Raise up into straight buttocks ashi
* Control the leg by gripping your thigh or stomach
* Lift their weight up to load them on their back leg
* Turn out and pull them

#### Advanced
* They wil lean forward so they can hop up.
* The usual place to do SLX is on the same leg (cross buttons). Danaher suggests instead puting it on the other leg (straight buttons). 

### Double Leg Ashi
* Standing Straight Ashi
* Opponent Bends forward and strips the feet
* Post outside foot down
* Move inside foot to cross hip position
* Grab the opposite leg
* Lift back to ashi eithe ron the same side, or on the opposite side

### Inside Leg Breakdown

In this section he quickly runs through a variety of sweeps from:
* X-Guard when sweeping to back
* Shin Guard
	* Double Leg
	* Single Leg

### Cross Ashi
* They start to turn away
* Apply pressure perpendicular to their body and into the hips
	* e.g. post with outside hand and turn knee out
* Don't pressure parallel into their hands

## Essential Skill 4: Heel Exposure

Absolutely necessary to consistently get hee hooks
Must be able to expose the heel in straight and cross ashi.

### What do we need?
* Elevation – The heel must be off the mat.
* Internal Rotation – The shoe less pressing in on me, sole of foot facing away

### Lifting Method
* Minimize Distance
	* Look for the knuckle line of their foot.
	* Set your back elbow on that knuckle line on the outside of that foot.
	* Forarm points parallel with their foot
* Elevate/Lift
	* Front arm reaches over and lifts the leg straight up by the achiles (either with wrist or palm)
	* Lift the back hand so the forearm catches on the achiles
	* Elbow will be on the inside, write on the outside
* Expose the Heel
	* Rotate your elbow back and tight under your ribs
	* Your forarm and the side of their foot should still be inline
	* They should both be pointing away from you

The steps of this method apply to both the straight and cross ashi. 

### Centerline Method

Starting from a straight ashi
* Grab their knee with the cross arm
* Put the outside foot on their side hip
* Switch your hips from facing out, to facing up/in
* Pass the outside foot across the centerline

### Tilting Method

Starting from a cross-ashi
* Grab their knee wrist deep with the outside hand
* Place inside elbow near the knuckles of their foot
* Extend the front (top) leg to hook under their far knee
* Pull your back (bottom) leg in close 
* Scoot your butt under their leg and use the hook and planted foot to lift and tilt them to their other side
* Lock up a figure 4 cuked under their near leg.

## Essential Skill 5: Negating Resistance

* Pushing the outer foot off of the hip so they can hop over the leg.
	* Switch to irimi ashi on the other leg: As they hop over the leg, grab the opposite leg, switch directions, and lock into the ashi on the other leg.
	* Switch to outside ashi on the other leg
* Standing to SLX
	* Bump them forward; reverse X; cross ashi

## Essential Skill 6: Breaking Mechanics

### General Theory
* Contrary/Coupled Forces
* Follow Through
* Slack Removal

#### Contrary/Coupled Forces
* There must be forces moving in opposite directions. For ankle locks we apply force in two places:
	* Ankle – The Mechanism of Breaking
	* Knee – The Mechanism of Control
For example, when doing an outside heelhook from irimi ashi your legs *must* face towards the outside and pressure outwards so as to apply external rotation to the knee. At the same time, the ankle breaking mecahnics (see below) will be creating a powerful internal rotation on the ankle. It is that external-knee and internal-ankle rotation that makes the heel look so devastating.

 
#### Details of Ankle Breaking Mechanics
Always start with a push on the toes; then a pull on the heel. 
Once their heel is set, we pull the elbow back in tight to th ebody. 
Their toes should stay in the crease of the elbow, they do not go up into the armpit.
Their foot shouldbe perpendicular with your body i.e. their heel facing away
Dropping your scapula down in a reverse shrug to increase the push on the toes.
Turn your body to face away and towards the ground so your head is in line with their lower leg
From this position, a small lift on the heel by extending the back will put a lot of pressure on the foot

### Follow Through

The point of breaking cannot be at the end of your range of motion.

Analogies:
* Baseball and golf swings don't stop at the point of contact.
* Good boxers punch through a target

You should be able to get your opponent to tap mid-way through the heel-hook. Possible without any hip extension

### Slack Removal

The more slack there is, the more speed and force you need to break. 

Pulling the elbow back, so the forarm is parallel to the foot, not the tibia. 

#### One Handed Drill

Practice appliying the finishing mechanics of a heel hook with only the bototm hand. The top hand stays loose. 

### Gripping
Each grip has a different amount of space. From largest to smallest:
* 10 finger / S-grip
* Palm-to-palm / gable grip
* Double wrist grip
* figure four
* reverse figure four

### Palm to Palm
The Palm to Palm grip is the easiest and most versatile, but you need to know what to do with your elbows. 

* Bottom hand palm down
* Top hand
	* Palm up
	* Cross-shin => hand below shin + elbow above shin
	* Elbow press down on the shin
