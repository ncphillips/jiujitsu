# Open Guard Introduction
## What is Open Guard?
* Legs aren't closed together
* At least one leg in the outside position

Aside: Butterfly guard isn't really an open guard

1. Understand the Concepts
2. Drill the Movements
	* Just to make sure you understand the basic flow of techniques.
3. Specific Training
	* Hone in to your weakness and start from there. e.g. if entering is difficult, drills starting from closed guard


Go for time rather then reps.

## K Guard Entries
### Basic Step
* Step 1: Get on your side with your bottom foot low across their hips.
* Step 2: Do these in either order
	* Dig for the scoop grip 
	* Get the knee shield up
	
### Positioning
* Bottom Leg
	* Foot needs to be just past the hip.
	* Achiles on their side
	* Not so far that it's easy for them to strip
* Booty
	* Not going to be straight in front of them. 
	* Off to the side, and in really close

### Importance of Top Foot
* Top foot should be under their shoulder and knee high
	* Let's you pull
	* Prevents them from pushing the bottom leg away
	* Hard to leg lock 
	* This frame gives the space needed to invert

### Space between Knees and Shoulders
This space is needed to curl in and get into position. They will try to occupy this space to weaken your guard.
* Knees
* Hands
* Elbows

### Controlling armpits and retreat
* Top foot is main control
	* Can be supplemented with a top-hand grip on the rear delt
* Top hand on the bottom side's lat /arm pit is a good control
	* If you pull them forward so their chest weight is on your shin then you can reinforce with the knee
	* Can reinforce with
* Bottom leg can switch to the arm pit, but you gotta invert

### Getting the Angle

We're looking to align our spine along the invisible line form their knee to their head. This lets us to more efficiently use our legs to push them forward and away. As this happens the leg we're attack gets light.

### Hips out to the side for inversion
Hips out. Up on shoulder. Knee down. Roll through to attach deep to the kguard.

If your hips are not out, it exposes your neck for the cross face.

### Leg Grip: 2 or 1?
The big danger is the cross face. With that they can powerfully sprall and break the grip. 

2 is a stronger grip, but it requires our legs be framing effectively to prevent the cross face

Usually you want to use the top hand to:
* prevent the crossface
* frame so you can pummel the leg

### Pummeling the top leg
#### Far Grip
Invert, pull leg up high towards your head
Externally rotate the leg
