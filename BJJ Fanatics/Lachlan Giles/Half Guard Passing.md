* Front leg
	* Up on foot, pushing in towards that top shoulder. 
* Front hand 
	* Grip the bottom knee and pull up, preventing the technical standup
	* Switch to the posting wrist/elbow to pull their post away while driving in

#### Windshield Wiper
Windshield wipers allow to staple your opponents limb to the ground with posts on either side. If you're only on one side of the leg, then your opponent could use their hook to prevent you from passing to one side. The windshield wipers give you the option to move in either direction.


#### Focussing Pressure on Top Leg

* Pressure on the top leg is key to the smash pass.
* Bottom leg might be edged to prevent them from bring it to the chest. 


#### Opening the Leg for Windshield Wiper

You want to drive their top leg forward (i.e. pike position) with your back knee. The pressure from your back knee should be directed at their calve to prevent them from curling their leg and hooking. Switch your hips away to drive their leg forward. 

#### Splitting the Legs

Once you've extended their top leg, you can pummel your front legbehind their ankle. This lets you switch to using your back knee to push their bottom leg back even further. Their top leg will be perpendicular, their bottom leg parallell with thier body. This means they have a really long way to go to recover guard.

#### Top Arm Positioning 

* The top arm is tight around their waiste.
* Elbow high, pointing up
* Shoulder low in front, almost on theirstomach.

#### Timing the Pass

The timing for completing the smash pass usually happens when they try to recover their guard. 

### Smash Pass to Mount

Assuming you've entered the smash pass and successfully knee cut over their bottom leg.
* Reposition your head from the inside to the outside
* Switch your hips so the legs switch jobs
	* Front leg slides in under their top leg preventing them from threading the needle
	* Back leg comes on top of their top leg preventing them from opening up 
* Use you top leg to scoop their legs towards you
