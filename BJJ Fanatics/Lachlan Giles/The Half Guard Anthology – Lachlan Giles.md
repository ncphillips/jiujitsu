Hands are better at gripping then feat. It's better to start sitting up then on your back. 

From standing:
* The Scoot 
* RDLR against knee cut
* DLR against nearside knee cut

From kneeling:
* Focus on the upper body frames first. It will be harder to get the leg through legs and connected 
* Butterfly. Head under theirs. Work for the underhook. Scoot to the underhook side. Go for the butterfly sweep, if it fails, driver your bottom hook between their legs to push their foot behind them. Take the top hook out and switch to halfguard
