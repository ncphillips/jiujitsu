# GR â€“  Attacking from Half Guard

## Two Worlds of Half Guard

(Mikey's words, Gordon's ideas)

* World 1: Inline Halfguard
	* The opponents spine is parallel with mine.
	* Their head is below the centerline
* World 2: Cross Body Halfguard
	* The opponents spine is crossing my centerline
	* Their head is above the centerline.

Each world has it's own attacks. 
## Butterfly Half Guard

Details:
* Knee is outside of their body. 

## Cross Shoulder to Underhook

* Pull Partner Forward 
	* Use cross shoulder frame to do a centerline shift from
	* Close knee into the partner
	* Bring knee toward your opposite shoulder
	* Knee Elbow Connection
* Get AC joint directly under their armpit
* Pull elbow high under their armpit to establish the underhook.


Note: Underhooks are much weaker when in a cross-body half-guard
