## Knee Slice

### Sticky Underhook

Dig super deep. It's not the wrist that hooks under his arm, it's your elbow. The wrists rotates all the way around so it's hooking the front of their shoulder.

Seated opponent
* Snap down the head
* Go for a guillotine
* When they reach for the knee from seated

Supine
* If they grab the ankle  (i.e. DLR)
	
	
### Picking a Side
You want to knee slice against the a lifted leg.

If you try to knee slice against a lowered leg, it's way too easy for them to get the knee shield in

### Knee Slice Entry

Let's assume you've stepped into a DLR high on their hip.

#### The Slicing Knee
* The knee on the DLR side is going to cut across their body
	* On an angle, more toward their shoulder, not across their hips
* You want it to land at least as high as their diaphragm. 
	* Doesn't matter if it's low by the solar plexus or high under their armpit. 
	* If you land on their arm that's okay as long as you got that underhook.
* **You gotta let the knee go first**
	* By having the upper body behind your knee you will add more pressure to the cut
	* Really blast that knee across
* Knee wants to be parallel with and close in to their body
	* If not, you give them space to get an elbow in and roll you

#### Inside Hand
* Hand on the DLR side knee
	* keep your fingers pointed forward so you can slip off to the underhook later
* Ankle Grab?
	* Yes
		* Pressure down on the DLR knee
			* That pressure prevents the knee shield from following you
			* That grip is what lets them track you with the knee shield.
	* No
		* Rest it but don't worry too much about pressure
* Starting to Cut
	* slip off and start digging for the underhook
	* during the slide, the forearm replaces hand as frame against their knee
* Pull your Chest to their Shoulder
	* Use your hook to get there faster
	* It doesn't matter if you pull them to you, or you to them
	* Do *not* lose the underhook

#### Outside Hand
* As you start to slice, cup the top knee and start to open their legs 
	* The wider the hips the easier to slice. If their hips are narrow you have to make sure to squeek past their knee line
* At the last second, change direction and jam the knee under/behind you.
	* This helps prevent hooking
	* Also helps increase the speed of your slice
* 3 Options
	* Post out far
		* anywheres from above their head to across/behind their back
		* ideal is behind their back so you're perpendicular with them
	* Neck tie
		* Pull their head towards you as you slice.
		* Use if you need to supplement the sticky hook.
		* Focus on developing the sticky hook first. 
	* Gable Grip
		* Helps keep the sticky underhook

#### Body
* Stance
	* Benefits of high stance
		* Generate more power for knee slice
			* Important if they have a strong grip on the ankle
	* Benefit of low stance
		* Easier to dig for the underhook
* Fall across the body so you're perpendeicular.
	* It's weird. Practice by really slapping the mat.
	* Once your comfortable slapping the mat doesn't matter.

#### Outside Leg
 * Swing that leg really high up to avoid the hooks
 * Post out with your leg wherever it's comfortable. 
	 * Don't have to worry to much about them grabbing your leg.
	 * The underhook will prevent a lot

#### Head
* Once you've sliced and planted your hand, you *can* your head to help keep the underhook. Ideally you don't have too though.


### Knee Slice Finish
#### Legs Open
* Clearing their Kneeline
	* Use your outside leg to kick their legs away from your slicing foot. 
	* Use the slicing knee to clear their knee line
		* Think of pulling your heel to your but, not pushing your knee back
		* Knee must be flexed to prevent them getting halfguard
* Slicing foot should be flat on the mat
	* If you're on the ball of your foot the able space can be used to recapture guard.

#### Crossface Strangle Pass
* If their legs grabbed quarterguard
* Crossface/Underhook
	* Drop head close to underhook shoulder to prevent pummeling
	* Let go of sticky underhook and post on floor
	* Outside arm starts to cross face
* Crossface Choke 
	* Crossface goes super deep, past his spine 
	* The cross face should be a choke threat
	* Palm down as you come in, palm up kind of down his back
	* The shoulder pressure should be driving down through his chest, not up into his throat else you lose the choke.
	* Gable grip to really put the pressure on
	* People often panick and start pushing away to get the pressure away, letting you complete the pass
	
#### Long Neck Pass
* Sit him up with your underhook.
	* Be careful to not give them space to repummel 
	* Also me worried of dogfight
	* Worst case, pressure across and push them down again
	* Use your outside hand to grab their bottom arm if they try to get up
* Drive your shoulder down in the center of his chest
	* Because the shoulder gets so deep you can let go of the sticky hook and rotate your hand down to the matt
* Start to drive your shoulder straight up 
	* Connect with the chin and push straight up
	* If he doesn't immediately give up the pass his legs will get weak.
	* It sucks. It can really hurt the neck so be careful.
* Outside Hand can do 3 things
	* Hand on mat
		* More power for the kicks
		* They can frame against your slicing knee
	* Hand on elbow
		* Less power for the kicks
		* They can't frame your knee
	* Elbow Scoop
		* Scoop their elbow into your armpit and pinch
		* Use your free hand to plant on the ground.
		* More powerful kicks; less chance of knee framing
		* A little harder to keep the elbow
* Put your head on the mat above their shoulderline
	* Turn your face away from them
		* Neck bridge is stronger then side bridge
* Drive in to straighten their spine
	* At first Hover your underhook hand on the ground and pressure laterally  to straighten their spine out. Use your neck bridge pressure to help.
	* Then plant your hand and really put the pressure into them
* If they lift their head Land Before Time crank
	* Get your head under their head and lift it up
	* This is also awful
* Use the knee scrape
* Did their legs open?
	* Yes
		* Awesome
	* No
		* Extend until their legs break open
		* Use your outside leg to kick off the top leg; then the bottom leg
* Give lots of power on these pushes.
	* You don't need frantic energy.
	* You need consistent, pressure based, make him regret rolling with you energy.
	
### Knee Slice Recovery
Failure modes (best to worst)
* They get the knee shield
* They get the underhook
* They get both

#### Knee Shield
* Bring chest to shoulder by pulling hard on the underhook with both hands to prevent them from pushing away with the knee shield
* Plant the outside hand across/behind them
* Drive your hip into their knee shield while you knee scrape

## Leg Weave
* High risk; high reward
* From head quarters
* A kneecut with their leg across. Kinda like a mid-stage smash pass
* Sticky Underhook
* Deep crossface, turned down on the back
* Get the back leg 
* Lift back leg up, and slice over t
